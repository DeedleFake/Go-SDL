* permanently fix KeyboardEvent issue

    Go, unlike C, adds pading before nested structures.

    struct A {uint8 n=0x11}
    struct B {uint8 n=0x22, A a}

    in c this will result in raw data:
	22 11
    in Go
	22 00 00 00 11

    This results in misaligned Keysym field.

    This is currently fixed by adding or removing some fields.
    Accessor function in C would probably be better solution.

	// static SDL_keysym* KeyboardEvent_GetKeySym(SDL_KeyboardEvent *e){return &(e->keysym);}
	import "C"
	
	func (event *KeyboardEvent) Keysym() *Keysym { return (*Keysym)(cast(C.KeyboardEvent_GetKeySym((*C.SDL_KeyboardEvent)(cast(event))))); }

* missing functions, threads and file access are useless in Go, but there are probably some usefull functions left
* add joystick support
* other SDL libraries: SGE, gfx ...
* more/better test/example apps
